In week 4 of Essential Design Principles for Tableau, we have an assignment that concentrates on presenting data to a manager whose requirements have been specified. We would be designing the Data Visualization with the following things in mind:
1. Aim: We need to identify the 3 most loss making sub-category in each region and also the 3 most loss making sub-category overall.
2. Pre-Attentive Attribute: In this case we are using colour as the attribute. To show the difference between the profit and loss making   units, we have used 2 colours. A dark red for loss making units and the light grey for profit making units. 
3. Gestalt Principle: Proximity
4. Parameters used: We have compared the profit ratio and looked after the loss making units based on the profit ratio.

**How to use the visualization?**
I have sorted the sub-categories based on the field of profit ratio. I have put the loss making units at the top and since we have sorted the data, it is easy for us to know what the 3 top loss making units are. I have also labelled the data so that the right information can be known. I have put the percentage form, and accordingly know how much loss we are seeing.
